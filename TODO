## TODO

Macros:
- DBL_DIG
	- Determine how this macro is used, wrap the macro in a portable manner
- COMO_OBJECT_API
	- Determine the proper way to expose the API as a shared library
- Macros for a printf formatter for como_size_t

printf
	- Determine the most portable way of printing longs and doubles

malloc:
	- wrap malloc in a failsafe way

core:
	- implement to_string for all object types
	- overflow checking
	- implement mutable bytearray
	-map:
			implement tostring on map with a full representation of the map objects
			for each key append to a como_buffer object
					- then call como_stringfrombuffer();
							and return

maybe:
	add a binary_ops struct to the como_type struct
		- with this, binary_ops would have a set of arthimetic function pointers
	sequence struct
